# Advent_Of_Code_2023
https://adventofcode.com/2023

This is quite challenging and fun as it requires me to think and use tools & methods that I do not necessarily possess yet. Through the exercise I learn a lot and expanded my problem solving and python programming skills. Win-win!


Day 1: Trebuchet - COMPLETED

Day 2: Cube Conundrum - COMPLETED

Day 3: Gear Ratios - Not Started

Day 4: Scratchcards - COMPLETED

Day 5: If You Give A Seed A Fertilizer - Part 2 is off...

Day 6: Wait For It
quadratic equation, no you don't need to go nuts over it, see the pattern and code for the pattern. Woah! Repeatable in Part 2!

Day 7: Camel Cards

Day 8: Haunted Wasteland

from this, I learned to use itertools -> cycle
For Part 2: I need to use math -> lcm. lcm is only available after python 3.9 so must upgrade python.


## My learning
I like using: for i in range(start, stop, step):
