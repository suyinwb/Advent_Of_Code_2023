# Advent_Of_Code_2023
https://adventofcode.com/2023

This is quite challenging and fun as it requires me to think and use tools & methods that I do not necessarily possess yet. Through the exercise I learn a lot and expanded my problem solving and python programming skills. Win-win!


Day 1: Trebuchet - COMPLETED

Day 2: Cube Conundrum - COMPLETED

Day 3: Gear Ratios - Not Started

Day 4: Scratchcards - COMPLETED

Day 5: If You Give A Seed A Fertilizer - Completed Part 1, Part 2 is off...

Day 6: Wait For It - COMPLETED
quadratic equation, no you don't need to go nuts over it, see the pattern and code for the pattern. Woah! Repeatable in Part 2!

Day 7: Camel Cards - Part 1 stuck = must write the sort for each card in the draw. 

Day 8: Haunted Wasteland - COMPLETED
While I understand Part 1 problem, I do not know the tools for to keep on iterating:
from this, I learned to use itertools -> cycle
For Part 2: I need to use math -> lcm. lcm is only available after python 3.9 so must upgrade python.

Day 9: Mirage Maintenance

Day 10: Pipe Maze

Day 11: Cosmic Expansion - Not Started

## My learning
I like using: for i in range(start, stop, step):
for index, value enumerate(xxxx):

convert complex number to real number to int: int(<var>.real)

find all the digits in a string and join them as one integer: <var> = int(''.join(filter(str.isdigit, lines[0])))
